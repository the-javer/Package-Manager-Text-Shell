I started working on this project about 3 weeks ago (as of May 1st, 2025). It is a text based shell for whatever package manager you use that is currently completely written using Bash.
For now, it is very limited in use and support, as it can only do basic functions such as installing, uninstalling, and updating packages. 
This release also only supports the Apt and Homebrew package managers. I plan on expanding features and support for different package managers over time whoever even sees this can do
whatever they want with this code besides copy and tske credit, which will likely never happen.
