I started working on this project about 3 weeks ago (as of May 1st, 2025). It is a text based shell for whatever package manager you use that is currently completely written using Bash.
For now it is very limited in use and support, as it can only do basic functions such as installing, uninstalling, and updating packages. 
This release also only supports the Apt and Homebrew package managers. I plan on expanding features and support for different package managers over time and whoever sees this can do
whatever they want with this code besides copy and take credit, which will likely never happen.
Make sure to extract this folder to your home directory and launch it from there manually or with a shortcut. This is compatible with MacOS and Linux natively.
